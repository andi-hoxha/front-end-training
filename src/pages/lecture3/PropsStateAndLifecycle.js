          Let us explore what else can we learn about the behaviour and the lifecycle of a React Component.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant='p'>
          A lifecycle basically means the entire journey of a component from its creation until its deletion. A React Component starts the creation with <Italic>constructor</Italic> going forward with a render of the UI based on the initial state and props. Every state and props update triggers a re-render, followed by one of the respective lifecycle methods
        </Typography>

        <Code>
          {constructorCode}
        </Code>

        <Typography variant='p'>
          A React component has three main categories: Mounting, Updating and Unmountin. Lets look at the each lifecycle method one by one, starting with the render method which is also the most used one:
        </Typography>

        <Typography id={render.id} variant={'title'}>
          {render.display}
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          Consider the following example:
          <Code>
            {renderExampleCode}
          </Code>
          As you can see in the example above, the <Italic>render()</Italic> method returns JSX that is displayed in the UI. A <Italic>render()</Italic> can also return a null if there is nothing to render for that component. One thing to keep in mind is that, the render method cannot modify the state. Don't use the <Italic>setState</Italic> (change the state) within this lifecycle, since you can get into loops of renders. Use the other appropriate lifecycle methods to do that.
        </Typography>
        <Typography id={componentDidMount.id} variant={'title'}>
          {componentDidMount.display}
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Is called as soon as the UI rendered and the component has finished mounted. This is where you can initiate loading resources, subscribing to events, initiaiting listeners etc. Here you can use the <Italic>setState</Italic> function of the React component, unlike the render method, which should be pure.
          <Code>
            {componentDidMountCode}
          </Code>
        </Typography>

        <Typography id={shouldComponentUpdate.id} variant={'title'}>
          {shouldComponentUpdate.display}
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          The return of this lifecycle method would indicate whether the component should re-render itself and any of the children based on state or props update. This method accepts true or false, or if you put it in javascript words: false, 0, null, undefined, or anything else. 
          <Code>
            {shouldComponentUpdateCode}
          </Code>
        </Typography>

        <Typography id={componentDidUpdate.id} variant={'title'}>
          {componentDidUpdate.display}
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          After the component did re-render based on changed state or props (not activated the first time the component is rendered) this lifecycle method is called. Depending on the changes that caused the component to re-render, you can react over here. Following use cases may apply:
          <ul>
            <li>If my configuration changed, lets reload the resource from an API</li>
            <li>Move the scroll position somewhere</li>
            <li>Recalculate the width of a child etc</li>
          </ul>
          <Code>
            {componentDidUpdateCode}
          </Code>
        </Typography>
        <Typography id={componentWillUnmount.id} variant={'title'}>
          {componentWillUnmount.display}
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Before the component unmounts this method is called for reasons to clean up resources. If you initiated a timer, or did a call at the API, this is the moment to cancel or clean them up, so that you don't have uneccesary resource leackage
          <Code>
            {cleanCode}
          </Code>
        </Typography>
        <Typography id={others.id} variant={'title'}>
          {others.display}
        </Typography>

        <Typography>
          There are other lifecycle which got recently introduced like the <Italic>getDerivedStateFromProps</Italic>, <Italic>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate</Italic> <Italic>getDerivedStateFromError</Italic> and <Italic>componentDidCatch</Italic> which we will discuss later on!
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant='p'>
          Putting it all together you get a nice diagram. In the latest React release (16.4) according to the latest documentation the following lifecycle is enforced:
          <img src={lifecycle} />
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          Image taken from: <SimpleLink href="http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/">http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/</SimpleLink>. Try the <Italic>Show less common lifecycles</Italic> checkbox
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          Putting it all together we get: 
        </Typography>
        <Code>
          {tickerCode}
        </Code>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          When the component first mounts and the UI is rendered, we want to initiate a listener that sets off every 1 second (1000 miliseconds). Every time this interval occurese the state gets updated to increment to the next state. The component updates only at the intervals of 2, that is only on even numbers. Before the component is unmounted we release the timer as well so that we don't have any more listeners triggering our tick method.
        </Typography>
