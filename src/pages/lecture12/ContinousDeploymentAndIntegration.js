            In this section we are going to talk about the last task that we have when we develop and application! That is to bundle it and deploy it! Inspired by <SimpleLink href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/">Git Lab CD/CI</SimpleLink>

          For this section we are going to focus on how we can use GitLab CD/CI to run scripts that automate code testing, building, integration and deployment!
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          The continuous methodologies of software development are based on automating the execution of scripts to minimize the chance of introducing errors while developing applications. They require less human intervention or even no intervention at all, from the development of new code until its deployment.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          It involves continuously building, testing, and deploying code changes at every small iteration, reducing the chance of developing new code based on bugged or failed previous versions. 
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          There are three main approaches to this methodology, each of them to be applied according to what best suits your strategy
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='title' id={continuousIntegration.id}>
          {continuousIntegration.display}
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          Consider an application which has its code stored in a Git repository in GitLab. Developers push code changes every day, multiple times a day. For every push to the repository, you can create a set of scripts to build and test your application automatically, decreasing the chance of introducing errors to your app. 
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          This practice is known as <SimpleLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration</SimpleLink>; for every change submitted to an application - even to development branches - it’s built and tested automatically and continuously, ensuring the introduced changes pass all tests, guidelines, and code compliance standards you established for your app.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          GitLab itself is an example of using Continuous Integration as a software development method. For every push to the project, there’s a set of scripts the code is checked against.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant='title' id={continuousDelivery.id}>
          {continuousDelivery.display}
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant='p'>
          <SimpleLink href="https://continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</SimpleLink> is a step beyond Continuous Integration. Your application is not only built and tested at every code change pushed to the codebase, but, as an additional step, it’s also deployed continuously, though the deployments are triggered manually.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          This method ensures the code is checked automatically but requires human intervention to manually and strategically trigger the deployment of the changes
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant='title' id={continuousDeployment.id}>
          {continuousDeployment.display}
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          <SimpleLink href="https://www.airpair.com/continuous-deployment/posts/continuous-deployment-for-practical-people">Continuous Deployment</SimpleLink> is also a further step beyond Continuous Integration, similar to Continuous Delivery. The difference is that instead of deploying your application manually, you set it to be deployed automatically. It does not require human intervention at all to have your application deployed

          Consider the following example for how GitLab CI/CD fits in a common development workflow.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          Assume that you have discussed a code implementation in an issue and worked locally on your proposed changes. Once you push your commits to a feature branch in a remote repository in GitLab, the CI/CD pipeline set for your project is triggered. By doing so, GitLab CI/CD:
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Runs automated scripts (sequential or parallel) to:
              <ul>
                <li>Build and test your app.</li>
                <li>Preview the changes per merge request with Review Apps</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          Once you’re happy with your implementation:
          <ul>
            <li>Get your code reviewed and approved.</li>
            <li>Merge the feature branch into the default branch.
              <ul>
                <li>GitLab CI/CD deploys your changes automatically to a production environment.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>And finally, you and your team can easily roll it back if something goes wrong.</li>
          </ul>
        </Typography>
        <img src={WorkflowExample} style={{ width: '100%' }} />
        <Typography variant='p'>
          If we take a deeper look into the basic workflow, we can see the features available in GitLab at each stage of the DevOps lifecycle, as shown on the illustration below.
        </Typography>

          Our automation rules for testing, building and deploying are all organised into a script file called <Bold>.gitlab-ci.yml</Bold> file! Our current setup looks like this:
          <Code>
            {script}
          </Code>
          By navigating at: <SimpleLink href="https://gitlab.com/agonlohaj/prime-front-end-training/pipelines">Gitlab Pipelines</SimpleLink> you will see all the pipelines that ran so far, based on that script! 
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          The important things to know are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The pipeline runs into 3 stages:
              <ol>
                <li>build</li>
                <li>test</li>
                <li>deploy</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              At the build stage, the compile job runs which bundles our code and puts the results at the /build directory!
            </li>
            <li>
              At the test stage, our test cases using Jest are run!
            </li>
            <li>
              The last stage which is deployment consists of three jobs:
              <ol>
                <li>pages -> The special Gitlab pages job</li>
                <li>deply-development -> In case the development branch, deploy to some development enviroment</li>
                <li>deply-master -> In case the master branch, deploy to some production enviroment</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ul>
          In our case the "pages" deployment looks like this:
        </Typography>
        <img src={DeployPipelineImage} />

        <Typography variant='p'>
          Due to the special job named <Bold>pages</Bold> this repository also got uploaded to Gitlab Pages located at <SimpleLink href="https://agonlohaj.gitlab.io/prime-front-end-training">https://agonlohaj.gitlab.io/prime-front-end-training</SimpleLink>
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='p'>
          In order to deploy to GitLab pages all we needed is:
          <ol>
            <li>A project</li>
            <li>A configuration file (<Bold>.gitlab-ci.yml</Bold>) to deploy your site</li>
            <li>A specific job called <Bold>pages</Bold> in the configuration file that will make GitLab aware that you are deploying a GitLab Pages website</li>
            <li>A public directory with the content of the website</li>
          </ol>
          Looking at the code again:
          <Code>
            {pagesDeploy}
          </Code>
          We can see that we moved the output of:
          <Code>
            {`npm run build`}
          </Code>
          Into the public directory by using:
          <Code>
            {publicDir}
          </Code>
          That in turn told that this job artifact is exactly that directory that we want to publish!
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant='p'>
          The content of all of our work is constructed like this (by running npm run build):
        </Typography>
        <img src={NPMRunBuildImage} />
        <Typography variant='p'>
          The important things are:
          <ol>
            <li>
              bundle.js
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Main repository Bundle file. All of our javascript code compiled into one big fat file!
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Index.html
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The entry point of out app

            </li>
            <li>
              Image files, ending with .png or .jpg
