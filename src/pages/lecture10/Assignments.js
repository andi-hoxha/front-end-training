          Full Description:
          <ol>
            <li>
              A Mocked API Project has been created for you at this location <SimpleLink href={"https://www.mockapi.io/projects/5cdde1216f4437001467a3c9"}>Mocked API</SimpleLink> containing the following endpoints:
              <ol>
                <li>Users: <SimpleLink href={`${API_URL}/users`}>/users</SimpleLink></li>
                <li>Transactions: <SimpleLink href={`${API_URL}/users/1/transactions`}>/users/1/transactions</SimpleLink>. That is each user with ID, has an enpoint to its transactions, in this example user with ID: 1</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              There will be two routes, one for users and one for their transactions, where content will be displayed accordingly
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Use the React Routing to specify those Routes, Links to jump back and forth between routes, have the Routes nest this page. That is:<br/>
                    http://localhost:8080/lecture/Assignments10/users -> Lists of Users<br/>
                    http://localhost:8080/lecture/Assignments10/users/id/transactions -> Lists of Transactions<br/>
                  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              For this assignment, put all of your state at Redux, implement all the requests to the server via the middleware!
            </li>
            <li>
              For this assignment, separate your implementation into Components such that you end up with:
              <ol>
                <li>Users (page)</li>
                <li>Transactions (page)</li>
                <li>Users List</li>
                <li>Transactions List</li>
                <li>Users Form (using dialog)</li>
                <li>Transactions Form (using dialog)</li>
                <li>Transactions Dashboard</li>
              </ol>
              All organised into /src/lecture10/assignment/<br/>
              Add your own reducers at /src/reducers into their own respective folders, each containing all the neccesary action types, actions and respective reducers!<br/>
              Reducers will contain the following model:
              <Code>
                {reduxModel}
              </Code>
            </li>
            <li>
              The users model will be like this:
              <Code>
                {usersModel}
              </Code>
              All the users will be displayed into Cards, each containing:
              <ol>
                <li>Their user Avatar (displayed as a rounded avatar image)</li>
                <li>Full Name -> name + lastName</li>
                <li>Email</li>
                <li>About me</li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>The date it was created formatted such that it shows how long a go this account was created: 2 days ago, 2 hours ago etc.</li>
              </ol>
              <Italic>
                Hints:
                <ol>
                  <li>Use card component available at the material ui: <SimpleLink href="https://material-ui.com/demos/cards/">Card</SimpleLink></li>
                  <li>Use avatar component available at the material ui: <SimpleLink href="https://material-ui.com/demos/avatars/">Avatar</SimpleLink></li>
                  <li>Use moment to format the date <SimpleLink href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/fromnow/">Moment Date, ago!</SimpleLink></li>
                </ol>
              </Italic>
            </li>
            <li>
              At the users list I can also search based on their email and full name!
            </li>
            <li>
              At the users list I can add, update and delete users
              <ol>
                <li>Add new users via a Dialog, using a POST request to the endpoint!</li>
                <li>Update an existing user via a PUT request to the endpoint!</li>
                <li>Delete an existing user via the DELETE request to the endpoint!</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Move to transactions page via a Link (Router -> Links)</li>
            <li>
              The transactions model will be like this:
              <Code>
                {transactionsModel}
              </Code>
              All the transactions of a user will be loaded based on his user id! They will be displayed into a Table, each row containing the following information:
              <ol>
                <li>All of the defined properties, excluding User ID</li>
                <li>The total ammount -> derived by multiplying quantity * price!</li>
              </ol>
              Futhermore, at the transactions page, the user information will be shown above the table!
            </li>
            <li>At the transactions page, use charts underneath the table, to represent information like:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Total Purchased products over categories (total quantity + total (price * quantity))
                </li>
                <li>
                  Total Purchased products over sub categories (total quantity + total (price * quantity))
                </li>
                <li>
                  Total Purchased products over proucts (total quantity + total (price * quantity))
                </li>
                <li>
                  Average Quantity between categories (On average quantity per category)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Top 5 sold Products based on their quantity
                </li>
                <li>
                  Top 5 sold Categories based on their (price * quantity)
                </li>
